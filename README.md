# Mental-Health-Treatment-prediction
Developed a machine learning model which predicts whether a person should undergo medical treatment based on a public Dataset extracted from Kaggle.

It included various parameters / features like Gender, Country, Occupation, Changing habits, etc.
Since it was a classification case , whether a person should undergo medical treatment or not , we used classic go to machine learning algorithms of Logistic Regression , RandomForestClassifier and XGboost .
Out of the three algorithms , XGboost performed the best giving us 75% accuracy.
Further hyperparameter tuning was performed , but there was no drastic change in the accuracy of it.

Next steps :- To perform various feature engineering techniques to make the accuracy reach atleast upto 80%.
